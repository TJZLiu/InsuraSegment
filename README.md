# Introduction
An insurance company (fictional), based in Portugal, requested a data science department to carry a Customer Segmentation analysis, in order to understand people’s needs and demands according to their position in each segment of clientele. The objective of the report is to define clusters based on client’s past preferences and behaviours, that would characterise the Customer’s Profiles, and provide recommendations to Marketing Department for the best approach for each cluster. 

# Initial Data
The ABT (Analytic Based Table) contains the original data with 10.296 observations and 14 variables.  There are no duplicated values, however, there are missing ones, which needs to be analysed and imputed for further clustering modelling. The descriptive statistics table shows (categorical variables are highlighted) that there are outliers present, like in FirstPolYear variable, where max value is 53784, or in BirthYear, with min value equal to 1028. The premiums have some negative values, which could be interpreted as reversals in the current (2016) year, paid in previous one. It could either because there were errors in financial transactions, and insurance company reimbursed the amounts, or these customers canceled their memberships and requested partial refund.
